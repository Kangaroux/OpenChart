`assets/` contains images and other assets used by the app.

`installer/` contains the files needed to bundle the app into a single installer executable. See `tasks.sh bundle` for more info.

`lib/` contains any external libraries that aren't added automatically by Nuget.

`misc/` contains any other files that don't fit in the other folders. This should be used for supplemental things like text files, launch scripts, etc.
