# Building OpenChart ðŸ”¨

OpenChart uses [Mono 6.12](https://www.mono-project.com/) and [SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/).

### Build Script

There is an included `tasks.sh` script for automating a lot of the development tasks, such as building and running the test suite.

Run `./tasks.sh --help` for usage info.

## Windows
In order to use the provided `tasks.sh` script you need to use a bash terminal such as [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), [MinGW](http://mingw.org/), or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

## Linux
Linux users will need to install SDL before the app can be run.

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
```
