- [Quaver](https://quavergame.com/)
- [Osu! (mania)](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

# Building OpenChart ðŸ”¨

OpenChart uses [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) and [Gtk 3.24](https://www.gtk.org/).

The .NET Core SDK is only necessary to build the project. When the app is published the .NET runtimes are bundled into the executable to make it more portable.

### Build Script

There is an included `tasks.sh` script for automating a lot of the development tasks, such as building and running the test suite.

Run `./tasks.sh --help` for usage info.

## Windows
In order to use the provided `tasks.sh` script you need to use a bash terminal such as [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), [MinGW](http://mingw.org/), or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

The official Windows builds come bundled with Gtk already. They are not included for development. If you want to build on Windows, do the following:

- [Download Gtk 3.24](https://github.com/GtkSharp/Dependencies/raw/master/gtk-3.24.zip)
- Extract the zip somewhere (e.g. `C:\Gtk-3.24`)
- Add the extracted folder to your PATH

## Linux
Linux users will need to install Gtk before the app can be run.

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-0
```

## MacOS
Mac users will need to install Gtk before the app can be run.

```bash
brew install gtk+3
```
