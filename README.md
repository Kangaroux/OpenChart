- [Etterna](https://etternaonline.com/) / [Stepmania](https://www.stepmania.com/)
- [Quaver](https://quavergame.com/)
- [Osu! (mania)](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

# Building OpenChart ðŸ”¨

OpenChart uses the [.NET Core v3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

[GTK v3.24.x](https://www.gtk.org/) must be installed to start OpenChart. Windows users don't need to do anything here, as GTK binaries for Windows come bundled in the repo. Non-Windows users can install GTK via the terminal:

### GTK for Ubuntu/Debian
```
sudo apt install libgtk-3-0
```

### GTK for macOS
```
brew install gtk+3
```

### Tasks

There is an included `tasks.sh` script for automating a lot of the development tasks, such as building and running the test suite.

Run `./tasks.sh --help` for usage info.
