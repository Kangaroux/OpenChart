- [Quaver](https://quavergame.com/)
- [Osu! (mania)](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

# Building OpenChart ðŸ”¨

OpenChart uses [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) and [GTK 3.24](https://www.gtk.org/).

Windows users don't need to download GTK. The repo includes the GTK binaries for Windows. Non-Windows users can easily install GTK via terminal. (See below)

The .NET Core SDK is only necessary to build the project. When the app is published the .NET runtimes are bundled into the executable to make it more portable.

### GTK for Ubuntu/Debian
```
sudo apt install libgtk-3-0
```

### GTK for macOS
```
brew install gtk+3
```

### Tasks

There is an included `tasks.sh` script for automating a lot of the development tasks, such as building and running the test suite.

Run `./tasks.sh --help` for usage info.
