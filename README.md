OpenChart is a free, open source, cross platform tool for creating rhythm game charts and maps. OpenChart is currently in active development.

We plan to add support for the following games:

- [Etterna](https://etternaonline.com/) / [Stepmania](https://www.stepmania.com/)
- [Quaver](https://quavergame.com/)
- [Osu! (mania)](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

# Building OpenChart ðŸ”¨

OpenChart uses the [.NET Core v3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

[GTK v3.x](https://www.gtk.org/) must be installed to build and run the project. This really should come already bundled with the project (like how `libbass` is). If you would like to add these dependencies it would be greatly appreciated!

[Please read this if you are using VSCode.](#Visual Studio Code)

### GTK for Ubuntu/Debian
```
sudo apt install libgtk-3-0
```

### GTK for macOS
```
brew install gtk+3
```

### GTK for Windows
Follow the installation directions [here](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/windows/).

Alternatively, if `pacman` is installed:

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3
```

### Makefile

- `make`: builds and runs OpenChart.
- `make build`: compiles OpenChart and copies dependencies to the output folder.
- `make run`: starts OpenChart.
- `make test`: runs the test suite.
- `make clean`: cleans `bin/` folders.
- `make cleanall`: cleans both `bin/` and `obj/` folders. Run `dotnet restore` to redownload dependencies.

## Visual Studio Code

Use an external terminal (i.e. not the one in VSCode) to start the app.

On linux (and possibly other platforms) there is an issue with the app crashing at startup if you try and run it from the terminal inside VSCode. VSCode injects some environment variables which causes both GTK and libbass to fail.
